            <h2>5 Tools For Freelancers To Delegate Work Easily</h2>
<p class="meta">08 Sep 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Initially, allowing someone else to get their hands on it feels wrong wrong wrong. But you can’t do it all. If you have dreams of growing bigger than a one employee show, you’re going to have to get used to it at some point.</p>

<p>By now you all know at least a little about the sharing economy, and (hopefully) realize that coworking is major part of this collaborative consumption trend that everyone’s been yammering about. Well, collaborative consumption can do a lot more than just give you access to a neat place to stay in San Francisco, or a bike in NYC.</p>

<p>It can also give you access to people. People who are eager to complete those tasks that you can’t or don’t want to. Below are 5 services that specialize in micro-labor: small jobs that pay a small fee. The brilliance is, you can cram lots of them into one day. It’s a win for those who are looking for lots of experience doing diverse tasks and those who have lots of random stuff to be done. (And if you’ve got extra time and are looking to turn it into extra money, these could be excellent communities in which to market your services.)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>TaskRabbit</p>

<blockquote><p>An online and mobile marketplace that connects neighbors to get things
done. “Fully vetted, entrepreneurial professionals contribute their
time and skills to helping people out, and those busy people find a
little extra time in their days. Neighbors helping neighbors — it’s an
old school concept upgraded for today.”</p></blockquote></li>
<li><p>Fancy Hands</p>

<blockquote><p>A virtual team of assistants ready to work for you now. For a low
monthly membership fee, you’ll finally get the help you need. You can
place your requests through the website, iPhone app, email, or ye olde
telephone.</p></blockquote></li>
<li><p>Agent Anything</p>

<blockquote><p>Agent Anything unlocks the time, talent, and ability of a city’s
university students. AA provides a platform where people and companies
can post small jobs, tasks, and errands to a skilled and affordable
workforce. “Agents can be hired to accomplish any task, errand or job
you can think of. For the last two years, we’ve provided
errand-runners for working moms, beta testers for startups, temp
workers for small businesses, and street teams for major corporations.”</p></blockquote></li>
<li><p>Gig Walk</p>

<blockquote><p>The world’s largest on-demand mobile workforce connecting businesses
large and small to their very own on-demand smartphone army. Since its
launch in May 2011, over 300,000 Gigwalkers have completed temporary
field work such as store audits, mystery shopping, competitive
tracking, customer interviews, field photography and much more.</p></blockquote></li>
<li><p>Swappin</p>

<blockquote><p>Create a profile including what you have to give and what you need to
get. Include skills and services you have to offer, and ones you’d
like to receive. These can include anything from professional services
to casual tasks and everything in between. You can even swap with
old-fashioned cash if that’s what you have or need. After you’ve
created your profile, Swappin will suggest people to swap with in your
area. You can also browse other members’ HAVEs and NEEDs on your own
and suggest a swap.</p></blockquote></li>
